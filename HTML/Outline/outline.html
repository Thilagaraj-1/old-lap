Designed by Google, the Tensor G1 and Tensor G2 leaned heavily into supporting artificial intelligence and machine learning on the handset by hardcoding many routines into the silicon.
        
        With rumored additions of AI routines to the video editing suite to improve picture quality and remove background noise from the recordings, you can be sure there is a close match between the software and the hardware.
        
        Many will be looking to see if the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro address one of the ongoing criticisms of the Pixel 7 family, namely the raised operating temperatures of the phones. There will be a correlation between the demand placed on the hardware with higher demand on the Tensor chipset, resulting in higher temperatures.
