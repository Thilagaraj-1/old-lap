            v.intr.
            1. To travel as a commuter: She commuted each day to her office downtown by subway.
            2.
            a. To make substitution or exchange.
            b. To serve as a substitute.
            3. To pay in gross, usually at a reduced rate, rather than in individual payments.
            4. Mathematics & Logic To satisfy a commutative property. If a b = b  a, then a commutes with b, regardless of whether the operation indicated by  is commutative.
            v.tr.
            1. To substitute (one thing for another); exchange.
            2. To change (a penalty, debt, or payment) to a less severe one.
            n.
            An act or instance of commuting, especially the trip made by a commuter: a 22-mile commute; an easy commute.
